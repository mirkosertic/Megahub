# Blockly Block SVG Images

This directory contains automatically generated SVG images of all Blockly blocks used in the Megahub project.

## Organization

The SVG files are organized by category:
- `control-flow/` - Control flow blocks (init, threads, wait, etc.)
- `logic/` - Logic blocks (if, compare, operations, etc.)
- `loop/` - Loop blocks (repeat, for, etc.)
- `math/` - Math blocks (numbers, arithmetic, etc.)
- `text/` - Text manipulation blocks
- `lists/` - List manipulation blocks
- `i-o/` - I/O blocks (digital read/write, pins, motors)
- `lego-/` - LEGO sensor blocks
- `gamepad/` - Gamepad input blocks
- `fastled/` - FastLED blocks for RGB lighting
- `imu/` - IMU sensor blocks
- `ui/` - UI blocks
- `debug/` - Debug utility blocks

## Generation

These SVG images are automatically generated by the documentation build script:

```bash
npm run generate-docs
```

The script uses Puppeteer to render each block in a headless browser and exports it as SVG.

## Usage

These images are referenced in the main documentation file (`BLOCKS.md`) and provide visual representations of how each block appears in the Blockly editor.

## Maintenance

Do not edit these files manually. They are regenerated automatically as part of the build process (`npm run prebuild:bt` and `npm run prebuild:web`).
